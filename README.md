- 👋 Hi, I’m @RicardoLopezT
- 👀 I’m interested in water resources (hydrography, hydrology and hydraulics) and astrophysics (local solar environment and solar system).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning workflows in cooperative environments.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...something, once I learn how to to do it!
- 📫 Reach me via my email, at least until I learn more about these cooperative work environments.
